# Inline Javascript Demo

Simple web server demonstrates how to run Sift Science Javascript integration locally embedded within each page (rather than by fetching the code from the Sift Science CDN).

``
$ BEACON_KEY=my_beacon_key python application.py
``

Replace the variable `my_beacon_key` with the appropriate key from the [Sift Science Console](https://siftscience.com/console/developer/api-keys).

Then visit http://localhost:5000 to test.
